# CS50-Final

I completed Harvard's free online CS50x course a while back, which you can find here: [https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/). For my final project, I created a webpage to calculate your GPA with Python and Flask. I probably won't ever update this again, but it's here if you want it.

Also, if you are currently enrolled in CS50 or CS50x, don't copy my code and claim it's yours. Feel free to look at it and get ideas from it (that's why it's public), but don't plagiarize.
